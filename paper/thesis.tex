\ctufitabstractCZE{Tato práce představuje překladový frontend pro programovací jazyk \texttt{tinyC} používaný v kurzu NI-GEN, navržený k usnadnění implementace backendu v různých programovacích jazycích. Frontend nabízí jak standardizované JSON rozhraní pro jazykově nezávislý vývoj backendu, tak i přímé použití C++ knihovny. Na základě analýzy technologií parserů a reprezentací AST implementace zahrnuje rekurzivní sestupný parser s LL(1) gramatikou, sledování pozic ve zdrojovém kódu a definované JSON schéma. Díky své přehledné architektuře a dokumentaci slouží tento frontend jako výukový nástroj při zachování rozšiřitelnosti pro budoucí vylepšení.}
\ctufitabstractENG{This thesis presents a compiler frontend for the \texttt{tinyC} programming language used in the NI-GEN course, designed to facilitate backend implementation in diverse programming languages. The frontend offers both a standardized JSON interface for language-agnostic backend development and a direct C++ library option. Based on analysis of parser technologies and AST representations, the implementation features a recursive descent parser with LL(1) grammar, source location tracking, and a defined JSON schema. With its clean architecture and documentation, this frontend serves as an educational tool while maintaining extensibility for future enhancements.}
